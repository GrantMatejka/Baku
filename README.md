# What is Baku?
Baku is intended to be a standalone mobile application that provides a source of travel inspiration and real travel itineraries to its users. Each user will have the capability to share their travel itineraries with their followers, and to save itineraries from other users. They will also be able to filter their feed of travel posts based on a location of choice. The goal of the product is to create a platform where users can plan their next trip with the experience and tips from other travelers. In comparison to other current travel planning applications on the market, Baku is unique because it resembles popular social media platforms and allows for the engagement between its users. Not only are users documenting their travels and planning their next trip with this application, but they are also liking and favoriting posts on their feed.

## Mobile app?
While we may be prioritizing a mobile target, utilizing React Native and FireBase, Baku will be available on any platform, from iOS to Android to Web. So whatever device you own you can stay in touch and plan your trips with Baku.

# Documents & Diagrams
We have included multiple documents and diagrams in our documents folder to help anyone understand the design, flow and scope of our project. Some specific areas of importance are described additionally below.

## UI Prototype
Reminder that this link will take you to our *low* fidelity ui prototype. This means that is that major design decisions are not being made in this prototype, rather we seek to portray general layouts and functionality.

Here is a link to our low fidelity ui prototype of our product:
